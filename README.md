# how-to-git
How To Git is a basic yet useful guide to handling local projects to manage it in GitHub repository for users that face Github and git for the first time. How To Git is now less maintained since focusing on the cookie-basic lmao. Really appreciate any contribution to make the pages more functional yet easy to understand to others.
